# ps1

There is software to convert PS1 games in to PSIO format in batch, in order from best to worst:

* https://github.com/gabrielBitts/psio-assist-ex
* https://github.com/logi-26/psio-assist

By other hand PSIO launches 99% of games yes but compatibility is not 99% but 60% will create a forum to track this without censorship.
